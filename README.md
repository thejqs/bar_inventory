This is the very beginnings of a Python app for those of us with silly home bar inventories. It can show you what you have and how many, when you got it, whether it was gift, whether it's easy to replace -- that kind of thing.

And yes, the sample user data is an old csv of my home bar inventory. What, you don't do that?
